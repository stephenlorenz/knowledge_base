# Brand domain settings
- [x] add "refresh" to DNS settings (like SSL)
- [x] add logic to ContractBrand filter to block full domain based brands (skip this, the regex should allow hybrid brands)
- [x] do I need a FQDN field when in full domain mode or is serverName enough?
- [x] add PDF or printable/copyable DNS setup instructions 
- [x] create a brand pattern uniqueness validator and use the database to confirm that the pattern is unique
- [x] add "Copy" buttons next to CNAME mappings
- [ ] add more URL validation to Brand Admin tool
