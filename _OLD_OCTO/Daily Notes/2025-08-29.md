# Triage

- [x] Can't manage project on staniford brand, it redirects back to homepage
- [x] custom URL in Posting Tool has a 1 appended to octo-bch.researchally.org1:
- [x] In Posting Tool, I can't create the same study_key across brands. Each brand should be able to have their own unique study_keys. For example, both BCH and STANIFORD should be able to /study/example.
- [x] initialize STANIFORD and GERANIUM organizations and link them to the contract and brand

# Tasks

- [x] The contract manager can't get rid of new Researcher Requests from queue
- [x] The Project Manager header is very slow to load
- [x] occasional CSRF issue on /manage/request page. this is probably due to the redirect onto this page, which doesn't receive the correct xsf token
- [x] The contract manager should not be able to grant "Group manager" permissions if the contract does not support this feature.
- [x] compare octo_dev_v4_1 and octo_dev_v4_2 database schemas
- [x] speed up study publication, and if it has to be slow, provide user feedback that publication is in progress
- [x] speed up project manager header (duplicate, see above)
