- [x] prevent saving if validation fails  
- [x] Add "email verification" field to re-type email address (prevent pasting) 
- [x] Prevent non-contract email address patterns for contact email (see [[Study Contacts card]])
- [x] Unknown how to reproduce, however, I have seen the `Site Principal Investigator` card display note that a PI is required to publish, but then click on the `Fix Errors` button (in the [[Publication card]]) opens the [[Posting Tool]] with completed Site PI information. Saving, at this point, makes the notice disappear and display the PI. **RESOLVED** This was due to a restart of my local application, which triggered a refresh of the database. Essentially, a non-issue.
