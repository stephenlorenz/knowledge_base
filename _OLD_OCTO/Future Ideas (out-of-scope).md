#### Recruiting Card
- [ ] due to our relationship with Insight, should we update the IRB status and expiration dates when the IRB updates in Insight?
- [ ] Create an "eligibility" type form control which dynamically asks for eligibility criteria in the "I Am Interested" form based on the eligibility criteria of the study. For example, ask for age (or DOB, and calculate age) if there are age criteria for the study.
	- [ ] If this is complete, then we can rank roster entries based on most likely match, which would allow research coordinators to prioritize volunteer submissions.





#### AI/LLM

What are some ways AI and LLM can help users of a website which lists medical research studies for volunteers and researchers?


>  AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance a website listing medical research studies for both volunteers and researchers in several ways:
>
 >  **For Volunteers (Study Participants)**
>
>1. **Personalized Study Matching** – AI can analyze user profiles, medical history, and preferences to recommend relevant clinical trials.
>
>2. **Conversational AI Assistant** – An AI chatbot can answer common questions about eligibility, study risks, and benefits, guiding volunteers through the enrollment process.
>
>3. **Simplified Medical Jargon** – AI can summarize complex study details in plain language, making it easier for non-experts to understand.
>
>4. **Automated Pre-Screening** – LLMs can help assess eligibility by analyzing user responses against study criteria before connecting them to researchers.
>
>5. **Notifications & Alerts** – AI can send updates on new relevant studies, reminders for follow-ups, or changes in eligibility status.
>
>
>**For Researchers**
>
>1. **Enhanced Search & Filtering** – AI-powered search can help researchers find studies based on keywords, study phases, locations, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
>
>2. **Data Analysis & Insights** – AI can analyze study trends, participant demographics, and success rates to optimize recruitment strategies.
>
>3. **Automated Study Summarization** – LLMs can generate concise summaries of studies, making it easier for researchers to compare different trials.
>
>4. **Automated Documentation Assistance** – AI can assist in drafting regulatory documents, informed consent forms, and ethics board submissions.
>
>5. **Recruitment Optimization** – AI can suggest outreach strategies based on past recruitment success rates and participant demographics.
