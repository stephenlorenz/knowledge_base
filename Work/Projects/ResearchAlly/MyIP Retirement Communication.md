**Subject:** 🚀 Faster & More Secure Login: Moving Away from "MyIP"

Hi Team,

We’re making a change to how you log in to our test environment (**site2.example.com**) to make things easier for everyone and more secure for our data.

### **What’s Changing?**

Until now, you had to register your "IP address" whenever you worked from a new location (like a coffee shop or home). Starting on **[Insert Date]**, we are retiring the "MyIP" registration process.

Instead, you will log in using your **identity**—just like you log into your bank or personal email.

### **Step 1: Action Required (Phone Number Collection)**

To get started, I need to set up your profile. Since the new system uses SMS as a backup, **please reply to this email with your preferred mobile phone number.** Once I have your number, I will create your account and you'll receive an invitation to the new portal.

### **Step 2: The New Way to Sign In**

When you visit the site, you’ll see a brand-new login screen. You can choose the method that is most convenient for you:

1. **Email Code:** Receive a quick 6-digit code in your inbox.
    
2. **SMS Code:** Receive a code on your phone.
    
3. **Passkey (Highly Recommended):** Use your computer’s fingerprint (TouchID), face (FaceID), or PIN to log in instantly—no codes required!

### **Step 3: Enrolling Your Passkey (Manual Step)**

To make your future logins even faster, we recommend setting up a **Passkey**. Because this links your specific device (like your laptop or phone) to your account, you must complete this registration manually after your first login.

**Enrollment Process:**

1. **Log In:** Visit **site2.example.com** and log in using an Email or SMS code.
    
2. **Trigger Registration:** Once you are on the site, click the button that says **"Register this Device (Passkey)"** at the top of the page.
    
3. **Verify Biometrics:** Your browser will pop up a window asking for your Fingerprint, Face, or device PIN.
    
4. **Complete:** That’s it! Your device is now "enrolled." Next time you visit, you won't need to wait for a text message or check your email—just tap your sensor and you're in.

### **Why are we doing this?**

- **Work from Anywhere:** No more "registering your IP" when you change locations.
    
- **Higher Security:** This protects us against unauthorized access better than the old system.
    
- **Speed:** Passkeys are significantly faster than typing in codes.
