# Tasks


- [ ] investigate moving ad_end_date computational logic to the main migration scripts (or keep it as a post migration task)
- [x] Don't allow a brand to become active until it is associated with at least one contract
- [ ] confirm that the same IRB protocol numbers can used on multiple contracts/brands
- [ ] should the "Contract Subdomain (e.g. https://*.researchally.org)" exist under the contract or the brand?
	- [ ] In either case, if the site is _not_ a subdomain, display the CNAME for copying and sending to the contract client
- [x] If brand is not active or not linked to a contract, make this obvious in the SA console
- [ ] order windows?
