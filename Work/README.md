## Usage Guidelines

- **Keep work content separate from personal** - No personal items in this vault
- **Store sensitive credentials in password manager** - Never in notes
- **Use daily notes for daily work tracking** - Follow templates in `_templates/`
- **Link related documents** - Use Obsidian `[[wiki links]]` syntax
- **Tag appropriately** - Use `#dailynote`, `#todo`, `#bug`, etc.

## Important Notes

- **Daily Notes May Contain Personal Content**: During the 2026-02-10 reorganization, 34 daily notes from OCTO were migrated here. Some may contain personal tasks mixed with work tasks. These can be gradually cleaned up or split as needed.
- **Security**: All credentials have been redacted and stored in password manager vaults
- **Git**: This vault is part of the main repository at `https://github.com/stephenlorenz/knowledge_base.git`

## Related Vaults

- **Personal** - Home projects, recipes, personal life
- **Archive** - Historical projects (2021-2023), read-only reference
