-   Hi there! how are you this is John Patrick i'll be your personal advisor today. how may i help? 
    
-   Hi John. This is a follow-up on case 101565338592. I am still experiencing problems after the latest attempt (which you should be able to see in the case notes).
    
-   one moment i'll pull out your records 
    
-   Great, thanks.
    
-   base on your records your having issues with WiFi intermittent connection and you already have reset SMC, NVRAM still having the same issue
    
-   That is correct.
    
-   thanks for confirming no need to worry Stephen since i have you r records i'll continue this chat for you
    
-   I would expect a hardware issue except that it seemed to start when I upgraded to Monterey.
    
-   we can check that later if its an hardware or software issue, may i know are you using the same device to have this chat?
    
-   Yes, I am.
    
-   i see, okay i know you are already familiar what happens when doing the steps and since you have your case ID do not disregard it we will be needing it on the next step
    
-   OK
    
-   cool! Let’s try to restart your Mac on Safe Mode. Safe mode prevents your Mac from loading certain software as it starts up, including login items, system extensions not required by macOS, and fonts not installed by macOS. It also does a basic check of your startup disk, similar to using First Aid in Disk Utility. 
    
-   1 Turn on or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the **Shift key** as your Mac starts up.  
    2 Release the key when you see the login window, then log in to your Mac.   
    3 You might be asked to log in again. On either the first or second login window, you should see ”Safe Boot” in the upper-right corner of the window.
    
-   those are the steps on how to run safe mode, if the issue persist contact us back provide the same case ID, and i recommend to use a different device to contact us back so no need to be interrupted on this chat
