They submitted the claim with the providers name of Tina Waugh on it, and that provider is a tier 2 provider. You will need to contact the billing company and have them submit a corrected claim with the rendering provider you saw at Northeast Dermatology listed. I apologize.  

STEPHEN C LORENZ

 

11:20 am

Oh, that makes sense. Thank you.

Kristen

 

11:20 am

Not a problem. I apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else that we can go over today?  

STEPHEN C LORENZ

 

11:21 am

No, that is all. Thank you. Have a great day.

Kristen

Thank you, I hope you have a good day as well.
