Hello,

Our small team has been using the 10 user/free server version of YouTrack for several years as our customer help desk solution.

Our team develops a healthcare, patient facing web application, where on occasion, patients will voluntarily enter help desk tickets which include personal medical information (or PHI, "Protected Health Information"), despite our recommendation not to do so.

We are currently exploring options for expanding our help desk to include more users and to host in the cloud. From our research it seems that the cloud hosted version of YouTrack will not work for us, due to the unfortunate fact that patients will likely continue to submit tickets with PHI and it seems that the YouTrack cloud solution is not HIPAA compliant. Can you please confirm this is true? And, if so, do you have any creative solutions that we might not have considered?

Best,
Stephen
