# Triage

- [x] Move "subdomain" setting from contract to brand
	- [x] this setting doesn't make sense under a contract, for several reasons
		- [x] a contract can have multiple brands, some of which might be subdomains and some might be their own managed domain
		- [x] the brand is where we configure the URI path, not the contract
		- [x] the contract is the business side of the house, not the technical implementation
	- [x] When _not_ a subdomain:
		- [x] display CNAME (with handy copy button)
		- [x] provide field for their URL/domain (we might be able to use an existing field)
		- [x] allow entry of SSL certificates for that domain
	- [x] Add logic to `ContractBrandAvailabilityFilter` to prevent access to brand via subdomain, if subdomain is not checked. In this scenario, we can provide guidance on the resulting page with the CNAME, etc.
- [ ] investigate moving ad_end_date computational logic to the main migration scripts (or keep it as a post migration task)
- [ ] confirm that the same IRB protocol numbers can used on multiple contracts/brands
- [x] order windows?
