Hi Mark, Joe, and Jonathan,

About two weeks ago I reached out to you because I noticed several concerning changes to Securty Groups in the Rally account in the AWS Research Control Tower. The new Security Groups in the Rally AWS account are all prefaced with "FMManagedSecurityGroup". The security group rules open SSH, RDP, and SMB, among other things, to our servers. These rules are unnecesary for our application to function and present unnnecesarry exposure to our application security. I would like to remove these rules but wanted to clear this with you first, in case, they need to be in place for other reasons.

In the future, it would be helpful to know when these changes are made and why so we can be prepared.

Thank you,
Stephen
