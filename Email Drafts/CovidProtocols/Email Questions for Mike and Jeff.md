Hi Mike and Jeff,

I was great to meet you. I have reached out to my department at MGH to ask about the feasibility of subcontracting work. When I spoke with Christin, I believe we agreed on a $150/hour rate. I suspect it will take about 6-8 hours to get up to speed with the application.

I realize I really don't have too many questions right now. I think I mostly need to be able to access the GitHub repositories and also access to the various cloud services which make up the stack, such as Google Cloud Platform and Netlify. At some point, access to the app store accounts (Apple and Google Play) might also be helpful. Once I can clone the GitHub repositories, I can attempt to build and run the application locally and look into the search issues.

I'm sure I will have more questions as I start to look at the code and better understand the stack. I will not be shy about reaching out with more questions!

Please let me know if you have any questions about this.

Best,
Stephen
